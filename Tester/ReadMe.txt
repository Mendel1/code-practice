This project contains most of problems I have solved in project euler.

For instance:
void Problem11();

that function is a solution to Problem 11 in Project Euler.
Tips:
#Some function is not written in this format before.
#Some function has several version because I tried to improve it by trying diffrent way.

Some problem I think it make sense for me are introduced in my blog:http://mende.ml/
